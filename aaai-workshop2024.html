        <h1>Anomaly Detection in Scientific Domains AAAI Workshop</h1> 
            <h3>Tuesday, March 4, 2025 from 9am to 6pm</h3>
            <h3>Philadeliphia, PA, USA</h3>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Scientific discovery often involves the observation of an inconsistency among “normal” patterns within our data. The observation of something different, incongruous with the data, is what we call anomaly detection. 
            Looking for anomalies is quite different from other tasks since we do not know what exactly to look for—we just need to look for something different. The goal of this workshop is to nurture the community of researchers working at the intersection of machine learning and various scientific domains toward scientific discovery. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This workshop will also serve as the award ceremony with special recognition of the winners for the <a href="https://www.nsfhdr.org/mlchallenge" target="_blank">1st HDR Interdisciplinary Machine Learning Challenge</a> focusing on anomaly detection. 
            The challenge is a series of 4 challenges one for each of three distinct scientific domains (biology, physics, and climate science), and a combined challenge across domains. A critical element of this challenge was the integration of FAIR and Reproducible science. 
        </p>
       
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>
            Our 1-day workshop will include keynote/invited talks, contributed paper presentations, a poster session, a panel discussion, and winning team presentations of their solutions to the challenge.
        </p>
        <h2>Attendance</h2>
        <p>
            The intended audience for this workshop includes (a) AI/ML/data science researchers working on topics such as anomaly and novelty detection, out-of-distribution detection, open world recognition, scientific discovery, and FAIR dataset and reproducible workflows, who are looking for novel interdisciplinary research problems; (b) domain scientists working on problems with data-driven scientific discoveries.

    <p><b>9:10 - 9:45am</b>: Eric Nalisnick&mdash;<b>Anomalous Anomalies: Monitoring and Adapting Anomaly Detectors</b>

            <b>Bio:</b> Eric Nalisnick is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University. His research interests span statistical machine learning and probabilistic modeling, with an emphasis on quantifying uncertainty in deep learning, human-AI collaboration, specifying prior knowledge, and detecting distribution shift. He previously was an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge and a PhD student at the University of California, Irvine. Eric has also held research positions at DeepMind, Microsoft, Twitter, and Amazon. His papers have been recognized with selective oral presentations (ECCV 2024) and awards (AIStats 2023, AIStats 2024).</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Anomaly detectors perform essential tasks ranging from protecting an autonomous system from abnormal inputs to isolating interesting scientific signals that may lead to discovery.  However, how do we know that the anomaly detector will be robust?  The detector itself could be susceptible to failure if there is a change in the distribution of anomalies expected.  And to make matters worse, we usually don't have an abundance of test-time anomalies that are labeled as such.  In this talk, I will discuss my group's recent work on monitoring if our anomaly detector is still valid and adapting it to data shift, without supervision.</p>

    <p><b>9:45 - 10:20am</b>: Jennifer Ngadiuba&mdash;<b>Boosting sensitivity to new physics at the LHC with anomaly detection</b>

            <b>Bio:</b> Jennifer Ngadiuba, a Wilson Fellow at Fermilab since 2021, specializes in searching for new physics in collider data and advancing AI applications in high-energy physics. After earning her Ph.D. from the University of Zurich, she contributed to CMS experiment studies, focusing on diboson resonances and jet substructure techniques. Starting when she was research fellow at CERN and Caltech, she pioneered deep learning for anomaly detection and fast machine learning on FPGAs for real-time systems in particle physics. Her work earned her the DOE AI4HEP award and AI2050 fellowship in 2023, recognizing her transformative contributions to experimental physics and machine learning.</p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> Anomaly detection techniques have been proposed as a way to mitigate the impact of
                model-specific assumptions when searching for new physics at the LHC. In this talk I will
                discuss how these techniques, when based on modern AI developments, could be utilized
                at different stages of data processing workflow, from real-time systems to offline analysis,
                and the impact they could have to revolutionize the current paradigms in the search for
                new physics.</p>

Dieng's research has been covered in media such as the New Scientist and TechXplore. She hails from Kaolack, Senegal. </p>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> This talk will cover the concepts, tools, and methods that make up Vendi Scoring, a new research direction focused on the concept of diversity. I’ll begin by introducing the Vendi Scores, a family of diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics, along with their extensions. Next, I’ll discuss algorithms for efficiently searching large materials databases and exploring complex energy landscapes, such as those found in molecular simulations, using the Vendi Scores. Finally, I’ll introduce the new concept of 'algorithmic microscopy,' which stems from Vendi Scoring, and describe the Vendiscope, the first algorithmic microscope designed to help scientists zoom in on large data collections for data-driven discovery.</p>

                <li>How do we ensure FAIR reproducibility of these discoveries?</li>
                <li>What interpretable AI/ML approaches can lead to direct explanations of these discoveries?</li>

        <p>
            We are accepting extended abstract submissions for position, review, or research results (up to 2 pages, excluding references). Shorter versions (up to 6 pages, excluding references) of articles in submission or accepted at other venues (or presented after Oct. 1, 2024) are acceptable as long as they do not violate the dual-submission policy of the other venue. We allow the addition of an appendix (no page limit) following references. All submissions will undergo peer review (double-blind).
        </p>
        <p>
            Submissions should follow the AAAI template format (two-column, camera-ready style; <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit25/" target="_blank">AAAI Author Kit</a>) and submitted via CMT.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>The accepted paper will <b>NOT</b> be archived in AAAI proceedings. This allows the authors to extend their work afterward and submit it to a conference or journal.</i>
