            <h1>Datasets</h1>
            <h2>Training datasets</h2>
            <p>These are labeled datasets that allow the proponents to train their algorithms. The datasets can be labeled with background and possible anomalies. That being said, the example anomalies do not need to be exactly the same as the test dataset. Moreover, the training dataset need not have the same exact background as the final problem. The goal here is to provide some comfort with the dataset format and how to process the information.
            </p>

            <h2>Testing/evaluation datasets</h2>

             <p>We will provide a public and a private dataset of the testing dataset to allow us to find the anomalies. The public dataset will be an anomaly-free dataset that allows the proponents to train their model for submission. The private dataset will include additional background events and pre-hidden anomalies. We aim to hide 10 (we need to decide on this) anomalies within the data to see if the proponents can identify them.
            </p>

            <h2>Evaluation datasets</h2>

            <p>The evaluation will then be for the proponents to pick their highest 10 (we need to decide on this) anomalous events and then see if they pick out all anomalies. The leaderboard will be the efficiency of the selection.

            The evaluation of the models will be performed with Codabench. At the moment, we will use the existing coda-bench setup hosted in Saclay with the possibility of larger-scale resources at the NSERC computing center at Lawrence Berkeley labs. The leaderboard will be updated on a few day timescale to accommodate the possible compute required to assess the leaderboard.
